<h1>Fatal Attraction!</h1>

In the quiet town of Larkspur Hollow, an attractive little town, the body of Evelyn Cross, a beloved actress who once performed at the local theater, is found dead in the park at dawn.
The townsfolk whisper it was a crime of passion — but everyone seems to have been attracted to Evelyn in some way, and everyone’s hiding something.
The player must interview each character to uncover motives, lies, and secrets — and ultimately identify the killer.

Talk to the various town residents to uncover clues and make choices that will determine your fate. Good luck!
